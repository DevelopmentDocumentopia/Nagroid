This is a fork of the Nagroid Project.   I have been using it for many years (thanks Simon)

There were a couple of things I wanted to change and improve.  When I forked the
 code I was pleasantly surprised many of the changes I wanted were already in the
 code.    

My plan is to remove all the depreciated code and implement a few changes.   The current code was difficult to built in eclipse

Nagroid was my first project for this shiny new Android platform *g and
as expected it endend in a huge mess.

Currently i dont find the time to clean things up, implement new
features, etc - sorry!
